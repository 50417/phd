\section{Finding Bugs in OpenCL Compilers}

This section reports on the results of extended testing of 9 OpenCL implementations using CLgen. We found that all the compilers we tested crashed, and all of them silently emit wrong code. We divide our discussion by class of bug: first compiler and runtime crashes, then wrong-code bugs.

\subsection{Compiler Crashes}


\subsection{Runtime Crashes}

Figure~\ref{TODO} exposes a bug in POCL in which a kernel containing an undefined symbol will successfully compile without warning, then crash the program when attempting to run the kernel. Such a test case is trivial to generate, yet could not be synthesized by CSmith.

\subsection{Wrong-code Bugs}

Examples of bugs shown in Figure~\ref{lst:bugs}.
