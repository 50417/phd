\section{Overview of Our Approach and Results}\label{sec:overview}

We conducted testing using X different OpenCL configurations, summarized in Table~\ref{tab:platforms}. A \emph{configuration} refers to an OpenCL \emph{<device, driver>} pair.

\input{tab/platforms}

CLsmith used 21 configurations, covering a range of Xeon Phi. Csmith also used older revisions of compilers, which allowed them to show the decreasing number of bugs in compiler releases. We should do this.
