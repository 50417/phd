\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\cec{(ideally)} We make the following contributions:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item we present a generative model for programming languages which [is in some way more capable than prior]. Our method achieves X-fold increase in production efficiency compared to syntactic generative models;
\item we generate more human-like test cases for compilers than prior, in (some/most) cases eradicating the need for test case reduction;
\item we identify X bugs in commercial OpenCL drivers and runtimes from Y vendors. Our approach is automatic.
\end{itemize}
