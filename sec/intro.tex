\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\cec{(ideally)} We make the following contributions:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item we generate more human-like test cases for compilers than prior, in (some/most) cases eradicating the need for test case reduction;
\item we identify X bugs in commercial OpenCL drivers and runtimes from Y vendors in a broad study of Z test cases on B combinations of device and compiler. Our approach is automatic;
\item and we advance the state of the art in generative models for programming languages [in some way], testing neural network-synthesized code on an unprecedented scale. Our method achieves X-fold increase in production efficiency compared to syntactic generative models.
\end{itemize}
