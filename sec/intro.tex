\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Figure~\ref{fig:difftest} shows the differential testing methodology.

We make the following contributions:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item we find bugs faster than state-of-the-art. i.e. Production is slower than CLSmith but testing is faster (and no/little reduction);
\item we find bugs that the state-of-the-art cannot. E.g. compiler crashes from invalid inputs;
\item our test cases are more accessible than state-of-the-art. Code samples do not require reduction, and are more human-like in their use of the programming language;
\item our tool is not language specific. We \emph{infer} programming language use from examples. CLSmith requires expert-driven development for every language feature supported. 40+k lines of C++ vs a few hundred lines of Python.
\end{itemize}

    Differential testing across a single test case. A test case consists of a program source and runtime parameters. Outcomes are either the output of the program execution, a compiler crash, or a runtime crash.%
