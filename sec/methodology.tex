\subsection{Experimental Setup}

We conducted testing of 20 OpenCL testbeds, covering a broad range of hardware: 6 GPUs, 8 CPUs, two co-processors, and two emulators. 14 of the testeds are commercial compiler products, 6 of them are open source. We compare our fuzzer to CLSmith. We allow both to run for 48 hours on each of the 10 systems. For each generated DeepSmith program we create two test cases, one using one thread, the other using 2048 threads. CLSmith used its default configuration. The total runtime for a test case consists of the generation and execution time.
