\section{Testing Methodologies}\label{sec:methodology}


\subsection{Classifying test results}

We select the mode output across a range of devices. Voting is used to select the oracle output.
%
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{-1}
	\item \emph{Invalid test case} Program code and parameter combination is illegal (this is device specific), or some other failure (e.g. program timeout). We simply ignore this class of results.
	\item \emph{Build failure} Online compilation of OpenCL program fails.
	\item \emph{Runtime failure} One or more OpenCL API calls return an error status during the program execution, or the program crashes due to segmentation fault. Note that segmentation faults may be caused by compiler, in which case these outcomes should perhaps be classified as build failures. We do not account for this.
	\item \emph{Wrong code} Program terminates gracefully, but computes a result which differs from the majority.
	\item \emph{Okay} Program terminates gracefully and computes a result which agrees with the majority.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Comparison to State-of-the-art}

Like-for-like comparison of CLgen and CLSmith. Run the full stack of generation-execution-difftest-reduce for both for a fixed period of time, and report the number of bugs found.
