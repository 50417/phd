\section{Experimental Setup}

In this section we describe the particular experimental parameters used.

\subsection{Platforms}

We conducted testing of 10 OpenCL platforms, summarized in Table~\ref{tab:platforms}. Each testbed consists of a \emph{<device, driver>} pair. We covered a broad range of hardware: 3 GPUs, 4 CPUs, a co-processor, and an emulator. 7 of the compilers tested are commercial products, 3 of them are open source. Our suite of platforms includes both combinations of different drivers for the same device, and different devices using the same driver.

\subsection{Testbeds}
%HJL - Not sure if this is correct - if it is, ain't in the tables. So probably not.}
\hl{For each platform, we create multiple testbeds by various combinations of the following settings: running with or without compiler optimizations; running with a single thread or running with 2048 threads.}
%HJL alt- For each platform, we create two testbeds by either running with or without compiler optimizations.
