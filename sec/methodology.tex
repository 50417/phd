\section{Experimental Methodology}\label{sec:methodology}


\subsection{Comparison to state-of-the-art}

Like-for-like comparison of CLgen and CLSmith. Run the full stack of generation-execution-difftest-reduce for both for a fixed period of time, and report the number of bugs found.


\subsection{Extended testing using CLgen}

Through as many programs as possible at the devices. Try older versions.



\section{Experimental Setup}\label{sec:setup}
\subsection{Platforms}

Table~\ref{tab:platforms}.

CLsmith used 21 configurations, covering a range of Xeon Phi. Csmith also used older revisions of compilers, which allowed them to show the decreasing number of bugs in compiler releases. We should do this.
