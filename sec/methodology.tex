\section{Testing Methodologies}\label{sec:methodology}

We describe two types of OpenCL testing using our approach. The first is a direct comparison of our approach to CLSmith, the current state-of-the-art in OpenCL test case generation. The second is results from unstructured, opportunistic testing of OpenCL implementations using CLgen, resulting in XX bug reports.


\subsection{Classifying test results}

We select the mode output across a range of devices. Voting is used to select the oracle output.
%
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \emph{Wrong code} Program terminates gracefully, but computes a result which differs from the majority.
	\item \emph{Build failure} Online compilation of OpenCL program fails.
	\item \emph{Runtime failure} One or more OpenCL API calls return an error status during the program execution, or the program crashes.
	\item \emph{Okay} Program terminates gracefully and computes a result which agrees with the majority.
\end{enumerate}
