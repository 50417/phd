\section{Experimental Methodology}

\hl{Add this somewhere, it comes from old 2.2: Our harness takes as input the kernel code and runs it using both a single thread and 2048 threads.}

We conducted testing of 10 OpenCL testbeds, summarized in Table~\ref{tab:platforms}. Each testbed consists of a \emph{<device, driver>} pair. We covered a broad range of hardware: 3 GPUs, 4 CPUs, a co-processor, and an emulator. 7 of the compilers tested are commercial products, 3 of them are open source. Our suite of testbeds includes both combinations of different drivers for the same device, and different devices using the same driver.

\subsection{Methodology}

We run each generated test case twice, once with a single thread, and one with 2048 threads. We also run with and without compiler optimizations. All machines were otherwise unloaded.
