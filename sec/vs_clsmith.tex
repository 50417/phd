\section{Comparison to State-of-the-art}

Like-for-like comparison of CLgen and CLSmith. Run the full stack of generation-execution-difftest-reduce for a fixed period of time, and report the number of bugs found. Is CLgen faster? Do we have to reject test cases?

Table~\ref{tab:results}.

\subsection{Test Case Size}

Median CLgen kernel size: 12 lines. Median reduced CLSmith kernel size: 43 lines (894 lines before reduction). Figure~\ref{fig:kernel-sizes}.
