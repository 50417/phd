\section{Test Case Generation using Deep Learning}

\subsection{CLgen}

Figure~\ref{fig:deeptune} shows the test case generation process.

\begin{itemize}
\item An initial seed corpus is collated from GitHub (w. rejection filter).
\item Corpus is encoded for training.
\item LSTM networks model the vocabulary distribution over the encoded corpus.
\item The trained network is sampled to generate new programs.
\end{itemize}

\noindent In subsequent iterations, synthesized kernels may be used to augment the training corpus.

\begin{itemize}
\item Samples are synthesized by the network and pruned using the rejection filter.
\item The samples are mixed with kernels from the GitHub seed corpus.
\item These combined samples are labeled (synthetic or human), and used to train a classifier for human-or-robot.
\item The classifier is tested on unseen programs, and the accuracy is used as a fitness function for the model's parameters.
\item A GA mutates and evolves the best performing parameters.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{cldrive: OpenCL Test Case Execution}

Generate host code stub to compile kernel. If kernel compiles: parse AST, read function arguments, generate data inputs for arguments. Limited subset of data types supported: No structs, no irregular data types (this is just an implementation detail, and can be addressed with more dev time).
