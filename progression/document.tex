\noindent
The first year of this CDT was spent investigating autotuning
algorithmic skeletons for stencil codes on CPUs and GPUs. This was a
challenging but rewarding project which providing me with a grounding
in research approaches to high level parallel programming, GPU
parallelism, autotuning, and machine learning. In this document I
critically evaluate my work during this MSc phase, and propose a
direction for future research which builds upon the knowledge and
skills acquired in the first year, while addressing the challenges I
faced.

\section{Introduction}

Widen the scope of autotuning and to consider optimisations for
algorithmic skeletons at the compiler level. This will involve the

Iâ€™ve shown that the optimisation space of a fixed implementation can
be successfully tuned using machine learning. The next step is to
combine these techniques with an understanding of optimising compilers
in order to generate adaptive implementations.

\section{MSc Phase Review}

In the MSc phase of the CDT, I developed a system for autotuning
algorithmic skeletons for stencil codes on CPUs and GPUs. The
autotuning was achieved using offline machine learning and a
distributed training set of empirical performance data gathered from
multiple devices.


\subsection{Contributions}

% Contributions of thesis:

The key contributions of my submitted thesis were the application of
machine learning-enabled autotuning to the workgroup size optimisation
space of stencil skeletons, and the development of a framework to
facilitate autotuning using performance data gathered from
synthetically generated training programs across multiple devices.


\subsection{Methodology}

A three-step methodology was used: identifying a profitable
optimisation space, probing the space to gather empirical performance
data, and developing a system to exploit this optimisation space. In
reality, there was a great overlap between each step of the
methodology. Identifying the optimisation space was achieved using
empirical performance data, and in turn gathering performance data
required partial development of an autotuning system. The broad
time-line for development was that the stencil optimisations space had
been identified by early March, the collection of empirical
performance data began in mid April, and the development of the
OmniTune autotuning system began in mid May.


\subsection{Evaluation}

Good things:

- kept a log, although didn't write-up as much as I should have
(especially on paper reviews)

- took relevant taught courses in applied machine learning and
compiler optimisations.


Things to improve:

- short development cycles, with milestones and reviews at each stage

- a more clearly testable hypothesis - i.e. a less vague project plan
