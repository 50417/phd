                            Learning SYCL
                            =============

Some practise programs and demos while I learn SYCL. Compiled and
tested using triSYCL. Files:

  001 - Simple vector dot product.
  002 - The BLAS SAXPY algorithm.
  003 - A matrix class which uses SYCL to parallelise operators.
  004 - Gaussian blur.
