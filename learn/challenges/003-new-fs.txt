A New File System
=================

You are given the responsibility of developing a new file system for
your company. Your supervisor is a non-technical person and so you
cannot ask any technical questions to him. Instead, you would have to
ask him non-technical questions that you expect he can answer; and
then decide yourself the technical parameters based on his answers.

What technical factors should you consider before starting to develop
the FS?

What decisions do you have to take and how would you extract the
necessary features to be present in the FS, from the non-tech
supervisor?


MY SOLUTION
===========

Questions:

1) What types of data are typically stored (e.g. images, audio).

2) How many files do you have? / What is the size of the data?

3) Do people need to share access to the same files?

4) Do you need to record modifications to files? (e.g. version
control).

5) Does the entire filesystem need to be encrypted?

6) Do multiple people simultaneously work on the same files?

7) How often do your computers fail?

8) Do people access files remotely?

Technical factors:

* File access frequency, and ratio of reads to writes.
* Write concurrency.
* Disk corruption prevention.
* Properties of physical storage medium, e.g. block size.
