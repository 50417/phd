Bit reverse
===========

Given a long string (array of characters), reverse the bits in the
entire string. The first bit of the first character would be the last
bit of the last character in the new string.

Write pseudo-code and explain it's working on a small example

Find any possible exceptions that might exist and how you could fix
them?

Can you think of ways to make your algorithm faster?

MY SOLUTION
===========

REVERSEBITS(char str[]):
  for i in 1..len(str) / 2:
      char f = str[i]
      copy_and_reverse_bits str[len(str) - i] -> str[i]
      copy_and_reverse_bits f -> str[len(str) - i]

  if len(str) % 2:
      reverse_bits(str[len(str) / 2 + 1])

Possible exeption: If length of character is variable. In which case,
treat string as array of bits and iterate over each bit.

To make algorithm faster, split string into groups of characters and
execute in parallel.
