My solutions to problems from "Cracking the Coding Interview: 150
Programming Questions and Solutions", Gayle Laakmann McDowell, 2011.

Each file begins with the full problem description as a comment,
followed by one or more different implementations, with tests. Note
these are my own solutions, and may not be optimal. Where I offer
competing solutions, I will try and explain the differences between
them.
