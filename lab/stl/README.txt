stl - A toy implementation of the C++14 Standard Template Library

These are my own implementations of the C++14 template library,
intended for educational rather than production use. Headers files are
included in 'include/ustl'. Unit tests in 'tests/', and benchmarks in
'benchmarks/'. A rough overview of my progress:

  HEADER
  algorithm        Fully implemented.
  array            Fully implemented.
  forward_list     Mostly implemented (75% functional).
  map              Work in progress.
  unordered_map    Work in progress.
  vector           Mostly implemented (95% functional).
