My name is Chris and Iâ€™m teaching neural networks how to program. This involves
mining millions of lines of code off GitHub and using deep learning algorithms
to understand not just the syntax of how to construct a program in a particular
language, but also what are the patterns and traits of programs which are most
representative of real human workloads.

My use case for this is performance tuning. If you are developing an autotuner
whose roles is to predict the optimisations which are best for a particular
piece of code, then the limiting factor will the number of pieces of code which
you train your autotuner on. What my research provides is an unbounded number of
programs which you can use as benchmarks, which have the properties and
behaviour of real hand-written code.
