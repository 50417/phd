Title:      Autotuning and Algorithmic Skeletons
Authors:    Chris Cummins
Presented:  Pervasive Parallelism lunch talk. The University of
            Edinburgh, Scotland, Wednesday, Feb 10th 2016.

Multi-cores and heterogeneous systems are now the norm, yet we lack
suitable high level programming models to cope with them. I will talk
briefly about how algorithmic skeletons will solve this problem, and
the progress we need to make for their performance to become a viable
alternative to hand written low level code.
