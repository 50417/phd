// Tier 1 is for irreplacable content.

// Tier 2 is for high-value replaceable content. These could be replaced if
// lost, but not necessarily easily.
//   Examples: iTunes catalog, system configuration files, digital downloads.
// Tier 3 is for disposable data. These can be replaced if lost.
//   Examples: Operating system files.
