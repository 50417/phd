# Technology Readiness Levels

Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) are a metric for estimating the
maturity of a system, with TRL 1 being basic research and TRL 9 being
a fully mature and bug fixed system.

As defined by the European Commision:

* **TRL 1.** basic principles observed
* **TRL 2.** technology concept formulated
* **TRL 3.** experimental proof of concept
* **TRL 4.** technology validated in lab
* **TRL 5.** technology validated in relevant environment
  (industrially relevant environment in the case of key enabling
  technologies)
* **TRL 6.** technology demonstrated in relevant environment
  (industrially relevant environment in the case of key enabling
  technologies)
* **TRL 7.** system prototype demonstration in operational environment
* **TRL 8.** system complete and qualified
* **TRL 9.** actual system proven in operational environment
  (competitive manufacturing in the case of key enabling technologies;
  or in space)
