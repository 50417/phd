I present a research proposal to develop an optimising compiler specifically tailored for algorithmic skeletons. Such a compiler would be capable of performing optimisations which are not possible by library-level skeleton frameworks: optimisations across skeleton calls (e.g. to re-order the execution of nested skeletons), and across muscle functions (e.g. to perform load balancing of pipeline stages). This document briefly outlines the proposed project, and summarises the findings from the MSc phase of my CDT.
