\section{Conclusions}

We present a novel tool for compiler fuzzing. By posing the generation of random programs as an unsupervised machine learning problem, we dramatically reduce the cost and human effort required to engineer a random program generator. Our implementation, DeepSmith, has uncovered dozens of bugs in OpenCL implementations, including in parts of the compiler where current approaches are not able to. Our test cases are small, two orders of magnitude shorter than the state-of-the-art, and easily interpretable.
