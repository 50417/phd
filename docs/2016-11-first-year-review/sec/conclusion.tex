\section{Conclusion}

The focus of my research is on the development of systems for automatically generating programs in a given programming language. Such systems have large potential impact on the fields of predictive modelling for compiler optimisations and compiler testing. In my first year I have successfully demonstrated and published an initial proof-of-concept of a new approach to program generation using deep learning, which generates an unbounded number of programs that are indistinguishable from hand written code. Extending this work to generate programs in arbitrary languages and exhibiting arbitrary properties of interest will greatly improve the utility of this system, and enable improvements to compiler optimisations which are not possible using existing state-of-the-art program generators or hand written programs.
