  \noindent
  The meteoric rise of machine learning is promising enormous changes to how we
  write software, spearheaded by sub fields such as deep learning. Recent work
  in applying language modeling to program code indicates that it may be
  possible to build models which fully capture the semantics of programming
  languages. Such models could drastically reduce the cost of development for
  compilers and compiler tools. Potential applications of such models include
  learned source-to-source code translation, automatic generation of tests to
  maximize code coverage, and automated generation of algorithms from high level
  specifications. I believe that innovations in machine learning techniques,
  combined with increased compute and data availability, have the potential to
  revolutionize the way software is developed in the coming years.
